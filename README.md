# RPG_Game

this is going to be a game about a monster in a castle filled with strange items. Try to make it out alive and collect as much loot as possible. There is a lot of randomness each run this is not meant to be a static game.

Meant as a learning experience just to get used to and understand OOP along with whatever else I use in the game.
